# CFB-PitchGradeCalc
This web tool was inspired by the [@MaxPlaysCFB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ1jxkcjMoQ) YouTube video detailing when to hard sell a recruit or when to send the house. The tool adds up the total points according to the input grades and returns a message of either "HARD SELL!", "GRAY AREA! (Sell at your own risk)", or "SEND THE HOUSE".

Grade number values (as per the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ1jxkcjMoQ)):

    {"A+": 13,
    "A": 12,
    "A-": 11,
    "B+": 10,
    "B": 9,
    "B-": 8,
    "C+": 7,
    "C": 6,
    "C-": 5,
    "D+": 4,
    "D": 3,
    "D-": 2,
    "F": 1}
